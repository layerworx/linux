# How to contribute

I like to encourage you to contribute to the repository.
This should be as easy as possible for you but there are a few things to consider when contributing.
The following guidelines for contribution should be followed if you want to submit a pull request.

## How to prepare

* You need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit an [issue ticket](https://github.com/layerworx/linux/issues) for your issue if the is no one yet.
	* Describe the issue and include steps to reproduce if it is a bug.
	* Ensure to mention the earliest version that you know is affected.
* If you are able and want to fix this, fork the repository on GitHub

## Make Changes

* In your forked repository, create a topic branch for your upcoming patch. (e.g. `feature--autoplay` or `bugfix--ios-crash`)
	* Usually this is based on the master branch.
	* Create a branch based on master; `git branch fix/master/my_contribution master` then checkout the new branch with `git checkout fix/master/my_contribution`.  Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make sure you stick to the coding style that is used already.
* Make use of the `.editorconfig`-file if provided with the repository.
* Make commits of logical units and describe them properly.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.

* If possible, submit tests to your patch / new feature so it can be tested easily.
* Assure nothing is broken by running all the tests.

## Submit Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Open a pull request to the original repository and choose the right original branch you want to patch. _Advanced users may install the `hub` gem and use the [`hub pull-request` command](https://github.com/defunkt/hub#git-pull-request)._
* If not done in commit messages (which you really should do) please reference and update your issue with the code changes. But _please do not close the issue yourself_.
_Notice: You can [turn your previously filed issues into a pull-request here](http://issue2pr.herokuapp.com/)._
* Even if you have write access to the repository, do not directly push or merge pull-requests. Let another team member review your pull request and approve.

# Contributing to this project

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return,
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing
patches and features.


## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs),
[features requests](#features) and [submitting pull
requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use
  [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) or IRC).

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; create a [reduced test
   case](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS
experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these
details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).


<a name="features"></a>
## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.


<a name="pull-requests"></a>
## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation,
accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).

Follow this process if you'd like your work considered for inclusion in the
project:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd <repo-name>
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/<upstream-owner>/<repo-name>
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout <dev-branch>
   git pull upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit
   message guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   or your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to
license your work under the same license as that used by the project.
